## Extras

While this was originally meant to work with Discord.js, it will work with any of NodeJS librarys, such as socket.io and more!.

## Installation
```javascript
npm install nodeactyl
```


## What am i?

Nodeactyl is an API For NodeJS to communicated with the panel, you can control ANY server on your nodes with it (If you purchase a server from another host, no worry! The API works with your own server too!) . Thie library original intent was to be for discord bots, but since this is in NodeJS, it is usable in ANY type of NodeJS program You can remake your own UI for the panel, and just stick with the pterodactyl daemon, doesnt suit you? use it in socket.io and have your node/server information displayed on a webpage! The possibilitys are endless! 

## How do i work?
This API works by using the pterodactyl API (Curl requests) to the server/node, by gathering the Panel website, Account API and a server/node ID. This library depends on axios, a promise basid http/https request system, this is how nodectyl is able to send curl commands to pterodactyl. The API itself is VERY simple and i am extremely suprised that no one has even tried making one (There are probably private ones, but none are avaliable to the public).


## Documentation
In the past we kept our documentation on our main README.md, we have no moved to `https://app.gitbook.com/@nodeactyl/s/docs/v/v2.0.0-english/` (Big thanks to @Elliot for taking care of the documentation for Nodeactyl!)
